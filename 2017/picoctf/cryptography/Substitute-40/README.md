### Substitute - 40 points

We get this weird text (full text on cipher.txt), that we need to decipher:
```

```
The name of the problem tells us that it's a simple substitute cipher.
Luckily, there are great tools that solve this cipher quite fast.
I used this website: http://quipqiup.com/, that generates multiple solutions.

The third one gives us the answer.
