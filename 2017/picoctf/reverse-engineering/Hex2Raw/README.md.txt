### Hex2Raw - 20 points

>This program requires some unprintable characters as input... But how do you print unprintable characters? CLI yourself to /problems/3ccd1ebb34d4cf595d1229d95aded6e8 and turn that Hex2Raw!

Hint:
>Google for easy techniques of getting raw output to command line. In this case, you should be looking for an easy solution.

Lets head to /problems/3ccd1ebb34d4cf595d1229d95aded6e8
```
$ ls
flag  hex2raw  input
$ cat flag
cat: flag: Permission denied
$ cat input
cat: input: Permission denied
$ ./hex2raw
Give me this in raw form (0x41 -> 'A'):
4991deeab0c6a24f0d364b51220e1911

You gave me:
a
610a
```
This attack is simple, we need to get the sequence of characters to match 4991deeab0c6a24f0d364b51220e1911.
In order to do this we end up creating the following script where 4991deeab0c6a24f0d364b51220e1911 is passed as input.
```
TESTDATA=$(echo '0x49.0x91.0xde.0xea.0xb0.0xc6.0xa2.0x4f.0x0d.0x36.0x4b.0x51.0x22.0x0e.0x19.0x11' | tr '.' ' ')
for c in $TESTDATA;do
    echo $c | xxd -r
done  	
```

Next we need to run the script and export the output to a file and finally pass as input to hex2raw the output generated by our script.

```
$ ~/level1/hex2raw > ~/level1/input
$ ./hex2raw < ~/level1/input
Give me this in raw form (0x41 -> 'A'):
4991deeab0c6a24f0d364b51220e1911

You gave me:
4991deeab0c6a24f0d364b51220e1911
Yay! That's what I wanted! Here be the flag:
