### Mystery Box - 60 points

> You've found a mystery machine with a sticky note attached to it! Oh, there's also this picture of the machine you found.

Hint:
> * It really gets your gears Turing.
> * I hear there's something Naval about it.

Both the png, the note and hints lead to Enigma: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine.

The note has this:

```
Geheimnis: PXQQ TAMY YDBC WGYE LVN
Umkehrwalze: B
Grundstellung: PPP
Ringstellung: LOG
Steckerbrett: G-L, H-F
```
Now we just need to decode it. Luckily, there are decoders online. I used this one: http://enigma.louisedade.co.uk/enigma.html.

Placing the info and decoding gives us the flag:
