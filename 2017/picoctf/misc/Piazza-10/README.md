### Piazza - 10 points

> Have questions about pico? You can ask here. The access code is 31337.

To do this challenge, all we have to do is join Pico's piazza.
Just create an account and join it.
After that, just find the post with the flag. The post is called "Welcome" and it's pinned, therefore it appears on the side bar with all the other pinned posts.

Opening it gives us:
```
Welcome to our piazza for pico2017! This is where you can ask us questions, and hopefully we can help you out.
Include what you're trying, what you expect, and what you observe. We're here to help you learn, not give you the answer.
Please put your question in the appropriate folder and search to see if we have answered your question publicly already.
