This was an easy web exploitation challenge. When we enter the website given, we come across a page showing a box saying "Access Denied":

First thing to do here is to view the source code of the page. The source doesn't have much since the page is simple. But one thing to note is something written in a comment that says:
```html
<!-- Storing stuff in the same directory as your web server doesn't seem like a good idea -->
<!-- Thankfully, we use a hidden one that is super PRIVATE, to protect our cookies.sqlite file -->
```
Ok so, we know there is a file named cookies.sqlite somewhere on the server. Also, we know that the page's image is stored on a folder named private:
```js 
background-image: url("private/image.png");
```
The next obvious thing to do is to check if we can access the cookies file. So I accessed the link: ```http://shell2017.picoctf.com:54399/private/cookies.sqlite``` and the file we want is downloaded. 

Now that we have the file, time to check this database to see what we find. I opened the file with [DB browser](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) and discovered a single table containing a single entry with the value of a cookie: ```F3MAqpWxIvESiUNLHsflVd```

Ok so, with this information, let's try and change the document's cookie to the one we just found. On the website, by pressing ```Ctrl``` + ```Shift``` + ```j``` we have access to the Chrome developer console. Then we simply write:
```
document.cookie="ID=F3MAqpWxIvESiUNLHsflVd"
```
And after executing this line and refreshing the page, the flag is displayed on the page:
```

```
